    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        The App Development Club provides members with opportunities to practice app development and learn more about relevant topics.
        The club focuses on development for iOS, Android, and the web, and is open to working with many other platforms.
        The club selects new projects each term to keep things interesting, and provides educational materials for new members to get up to speed.
        If you are interested in app development but don't know where to start, you're in the right place!

    <h1>Meetings</h1>
    <p>
        Meetings are <code>Wednesdays 6:00pm - 7:00pm</code>  in <code>Kelley 1005</code>.
        During meetings we typically discuss current projects, work independently, help new-comers start learning, and occasionally host talks.
        Club projects are decided during the first meeting of the term, and final presentations are held during the last meeting of the term.
