    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        The App Development Club provides members with opportunities to practice app development and learn more about
        relevant topics. The club focuses on development for iOS, Android, and the web, and is open to working with many
        other platforms. We work on a term-long cycle, where we set the end of each term as a sprint and encourage
        members to set goals for their project(s) at the start, and then present their progress at the end. We also
        ensure educational resources and support are available for any beginner programmers or app developers. If you
        are interested in app development but don't know where to start, you're in the right place!
    </p>

    <h1>Meetings</h1>
    <p>
        Meetings are <code>Wednesdays 6:00pm - 7:00pm</code> on our <a target="_blank"
            href="https://discord.gg/HCtGZsM">Discord</a>. During meetings we typically discuss current projects, work
        independently, help new-comers start learning, and occasionally host talks. Club projects are decided during the
        first meeting of the term, and final presentations are held during the last meeting of the term.
    </p>

    <h1>Club Structure</h1>
    <p>
        To help app developers pursue their interests, in this club we treat each term as an agile sprint. At the
        beginning of the term we encourage members to set goals and objectives to complete during the term, with each
        sprint ending near the end of the term (the week before finals week) where we hold a presentation for each
        member who so chooses to present their progress on their app. Participation in this cycle is completely
        optional, but highly encouraged.
